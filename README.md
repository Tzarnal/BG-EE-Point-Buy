# BG-EE-Point-Buy
This is a mod for the Enhanced Edition version of Baldurs Gate 1, Baldurs Gate 2 and for Siege of Dragonspear. 

It adds a button to the Abilities stage of character generation that lets you skip rolling for stats and simply gives you a fixed roll with the points already freed up to spend as desired.
Pressing the Point Buy button will cycle through preset Total Roll values of 75, 80, 85 and 90. It starts at 85 since this is the rough number I'm aiming for when rolling for stats.
